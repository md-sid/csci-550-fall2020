# Presentation

We have spent the semester getting familiar with multiple topics in data mining.
Some topics were practical (e.g., how do we pick *k* for clustering) and some
were algorithmic (e.g., what is the I/O complexity of various algorithms).  Now,
it is your turn to lead the class and help everyone understand something that
you are interested in.

## Topic Selection

Before midnight Friday Oct 30, propose a data mining topic that you
would like to learn about and lecture on. I may reach out to discuss your topic
further.  I will use your topic suggestions to organize the lectures during the
last week (or two) of class.

## Description

For your topic, you and your partner (partner optional) will lead the lecture.
You will have two steps:

* By at least midnight, TWO days before your lecture, post on the discussion
  board links to resources and a description of what students should do prior to
  your lecture to be prepared. Sources may be materials that you put together,
  papers, video, software to install, problems to work through, message board
  postings, etc.  Note that if you need to post content, for example a PDF, Box
  is a campus supported option for sharing.  Students are expected to come
  prepared to class by working through the material you suggest. Note that you
  should target the student preparation at under an hour, it should NOT exceed
  two hours.

* On the day of your presentation, arrive on Zoom at least five min early to be
  ready to start on time. You may use about 20 min of the lecture period.
  We will use the last five min to fill out a feed back form(see below for links).
  Feel free to get creative. Your lecture may be interactive, you can have
  people work on problems, write code, discuss in groups, or anything else that
  you think may help you to introduce the class to your topic.

* By midnight at most TWO days after your lecture, a (approximately) two page
  written summary of your lecture (either Markdown or PDF) that will be posted
  on the course website

* By midnight at most TWO days after your lecture, a (approximately) one
  paragraph to one page written reflection from the peer feedback and how you
  would incorporate that feedback next time you lecture.  This will NOT be
  posted on the course website

  You will be
  graded on the following:

  As a lecturer:

    - Pre-lecture materials (10 points)
    - Demonstration of knowledge of the presented material (30 points)
    - Preparation of the lecture (20 points)
    - Effectiveness of the lecture (10 points)
    - Lecture summary (15 points)
    - Peer feedback reflection (05 points)

  As a learner:

    - Your participation (10 points)

## Schedule

Unfortunately, the shorter semester means that we will have to move a few
presentations to be remote.  The first part of the table lists the times for the
in class presentation.  The part lists the times for videos.  Please send me a
link to your video (either on youtube, box, etc) by the start of class on Wed
11/18 (and use the due dates for presenting on 11/18 and reflections are due
11/22).

Everyone, between 11/18 and 11/20 please watch and give
feedback to at least 3 videos (your feedback will be counted towards your
participation grade).
