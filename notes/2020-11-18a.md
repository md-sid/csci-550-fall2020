## Graph Mining
* Extract interesting subgraphs from one large graph, or set of many graphs
* Could be looking for particular patterns
* Could be looking for any frequent patterns (given a min support)

### Applications
* Analyzing communication networks (internet, cell phone networks)
* Analyzing social networking communities
* Analyzing the structure of the web
* Identifying common interaction networks between biomolecules
* Detecting similarities in the chemical structures of compounds

## Graph Basics
* Vertices and edges
* Adjacent vertices are connected by an edge; **neighbors**
* A labeled graph has labels associated with the vertices and possibly the edges (similar to labels in clustering or classification)

### Subgraphs
* A **subgraph** is a subset of vertices and edges from a larger graph
* A **connected subgraph** is a subgraph in which there is path between any two vertices (i.e. no disconnected components)
* Graph mining is typically interested in identifying connected subgraphs

### Isomorphism
* There are many different ways of drawing or constructing graphs with the same underlying structure
* On a mathematical level, we can say that two graphs with the same structure are *isomorphic*
* Formally:
	* Consider two graphs, *G = (V, E)* and *G' = (V', E')*
	* *G* and *G'* are isomorphic if there exists a function, *phi*, that can map vertices from *G'* to *G*
		* The mapping must preserve all edges; *(U', V')* is an edge in *G'* iff *(phi(U'), phi(V'))* is an edge in *G*
		* The mapping must preserve all vertex labels; for any vertex *U'* in *G'*, the label of *U'* must match the label of *phi(U')*
		* In other words, mapping function *phi* must preserve all edge adjacencies and all vertex labels
	* *phi* should be **injective**, meaning that it maps each vertex from *G'* to a unique vertex in *G*
	* *phi* should be **surjective**, meaning that all vertices in *G* have a mapping from *G'*
	* If *phi* is **only** injective, then we say that *G'* is **subgraph isomorphic** to *G*
		* *G'* can be mapped "into" *G*; *G'* is isomorpic to a subgraph of *G*

## Graph Mining Methodology

### Subgraph Support
* Given a set (database) of graphs, *D*, and some other graph, *G*, the support of *G* (*sup(G)*) is simply answering how many graphs in *D* contain *G*
* Despite the simple question, finding frequent graphs in a database has an **enormous** search space; an efficient algorithm is needed
* Decompose to two problems:
	* Problem 1: Systematically generate candidate graphs to search for
		* A good approach is the "edge growth mechanism", where we start with an empty graph and systematically add more edges
		* The key is to not produce or evaluate duplicate candidates (prune the search tree); this requires graph isomorphism checking
	* Problem 2: Count the support of candidate graphs in the database, which involves **subgraph** isomorphism checking

### Candidate Generation (Rightmost Path Extension)
* The preferred edge growth mechanism is **rightmost path extension**
	* Order the vertices according to a DFS traversal
	* Edges found during the DFS traversal are considered **forward** edges; all others are **backward** edges
	* The **rightmost path** is the path from the start vertex to the very last found vertex
* To generate new paths from a graph *G* there are two options:
	1. We can add backward edges from the rightmost vertex to some other vertex on the rightmost path
	2. We can add forward edges from any vertex on the rightmost path
* General procedure:
	* Define a total ordering for all possible edge extensions (i.e. adding new edges)
	* First try backward extensions (i.e. #1 above), preferring to connect to vertices closer to the root
	* Then try forward extensions (i.e. #2 above), preferring to start the edge with vertices farther from the root
	* Note: we are never allowed to have more than a single edge between any two vertices

### Isomorphism Checking (Canonical Codes)
* Graph isomorphisms can be pruned by checking **canonical codes** of graphs
* If we generate duplicate (i.e. isomorphic) candidate graphs, we only need to keep one of them; think of it as assigning the graphs a rank, and then keeping only the highest ranked candidate
* General procedure:
	* Order the vertices according to a DFS traversal
	* Order the edges of the graph by following edges between consecutive vertices
		* Visit each vertex in DFS ordering
		* Build a DFS code tuple for each edge incident with that vertex: *<vertex_1, vertex_2, label(vertex_1), label(vertex_2), label(edge(vertex_1, vertex_2))>*
		* First order all the backward edges incident with that vertex (they have a higher ordering)
		* Then order all the forward edges incident with that vertex (they have a lower ordering)
		* Move on to the next vertex
	* This ordered set of DFS code tuples is known as the **DFS code** of the graph
* We can compare two graphs based on their DFS codes (equation in book)
* The graph with the smallest DFS code is considered **canonical** and is the preferred representation of the graph
* For the purposes of the gSpan algorithm, we don't use the DFS codes to check **if** two graphs are equal; rather, for a given graph *G*, we check if it is canonical, and if not, then prune that branch of the search tree

## gSpan Algorithm
* Recursive algorithm that operates on a set of DFS tuples (the DFS code of a graph), a graph database, and a minimum support
	* Initial call is made with an empty DFS code
* At each function call:
	* All possible extensions of the the DFS code (i.e. ways to extend the graph) are generated, and the support of the extension calculated
		* Uses rightmost path extension as described above
		* Generates extensions based on the graph database
		* During the first call (with the empty DFS code), the set of possible extensions is essentially every unique edge from every graph in the database
	* Each possible extension of the DFS code is examined
	* If the possible extension is frequent, we generate a new DFS code consisting of the union of the original code and the possible extension
		* Prunes off any branches of the search tree for subgraphs that aren't frequent
	* If the new DFS code (with the extension) is canonical, then recursively call gSpan, using the new DFS code
		* Prunes off any branches of the search tree for subgraphs that will be examined/evaluated via another search path (with the canonical version of the graph)
